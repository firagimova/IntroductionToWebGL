# IntroductionToWebGL

<h4>
  In my <i>'Introduction to WebGL</i>' project, I focused on 2D graphical programming using WebGL and JavaScript to construct my initials. I employed vertex strips and fans to efficiently manage and visualize vertex coordinates, showcasing my ability to manipulate basic shapes and lines. This project enhanced my skills in utilizing WebGL for practical, web-based 2D graphics development.
